<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Access Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-microbial Catheter</li><li>Non Anti-microbial Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular access catheters market is divided into two main types: anti-microbial catheters and non-anti-microbial catheters. Anti-microbial catheters are designed to reduce the risk of infections through coatings or materials that inhibit microbial growth, making them ideal for long-term use in patients at risk for infections. Non-anti-microbial catheters, while effective, lack these additional protective features and may be used in environments where infection risk is lower. Both types are essential for ensuring safe and efficient patient treatment.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arteriovenous Fistula Diagnosis and Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas</li><li>Peripheral Arteriovenous Fistulas</li><li>Pial or Cerebral Arteriovenous Fistulas</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arteriovenous fistula diagnosis and treatment market is segmented into three main types: dural arteriovenous fistulas, peripheral arteriovenous fistulas, and pial or cerebral arteriovenous fistulas. Dural arteriovenous fistulas occur within the dura mater, impacting brain venous drainage. Peripheral arteriovenous fistulas typically arise in limbs, often related to dialysis access. Pial or cerebral arteriovenous fistulas are located in the brain's surface vasculature, posing risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits. Each type requires specific diagnostic approaches and tailored interventional treatments for effective management.</p></p>

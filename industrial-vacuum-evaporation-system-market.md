<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Vacuum Evaporation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multiple Effect</li><li>Single Effect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial vacuum evaporation system market is divided into two main types: single effect and multiple effect systems. Single effect evaporation utilizes one chamber to remove solvents from solutions, offering straightforward operation but lower energy efficiency. In contrast, multiple effect systems employ sequential chambers, allowing vapor generated in one chamber to heat the next, significantly enhancing energy efficiency and throughput. As a result, multiple effect systems are often preferred for large-scale applications requiring reduced operational costs and environmental impact.</p></p>

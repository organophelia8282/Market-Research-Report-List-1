<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Pneumatic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear pneumatic cylinder market comprises two main types: double acting and single acting. Double acting cylinders use compressed air to move the piston in both directions, enabling greater force and control for applications requiring precise movement. In contrast, single acting cylinders apply air pressure to move the piston in one direction only, relying on a spring or external force for return. This makes single acting cylinders more straightforward and cost-effective for simpler tasks. Both types are essential in various industrial applications.</p></p>

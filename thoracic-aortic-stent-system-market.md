<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracic Aortic Stent System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Type</li><li>Branched Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Thoracic Aortic Stent System market comprises two main types: straight and branched stents. Straight stents are designed for straightforward, tubular aortic lesions, providing a uniform support structure. Branched stents, on the other hand, feature multiple branches to accommodate the complex anatomical variations of the thoracic aorta, allowing for optimal blood flow to adjacent arteries. Both types are crucial for treating aortic conditions, with their distinct designs catering to specific patient needs and anatomical challenges in thoracic aortic interventions.</p></p>

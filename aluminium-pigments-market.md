<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium Pigments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Leafing Aluminium Pigments</li><li>Non-Leafing Aluminium Pigments</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aluminium pigments market is primarily categorized into two types: leafing and non-leafing aluminium pigments. Leafing aluminium pigments are designed to float or "leaf" to the surface of coatings, creating a metallic shine, commonly used in automotive paints and high-end coatings. In contrast, non-leafing aluminium pigments remain dispersed throughout the medium, providing a more uniform appearance with less luster, making them suitable for applications like industrial coatings and plastics where a reflective surface is less critical.</p></p>

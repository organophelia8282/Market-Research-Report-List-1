<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EDTA Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass</li><li>Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EDTA tubes market comprises two primary types: glass and plastic. Glass EDTA tubes are favored for their inert properties, providing superior stability and preventing contamination. They are ideal for precise laboratory analysis but are more fragile and heavier, posing handling challenges. Plastic EDTA tubes, on the other hand, offer durability, lightweight convenience, and cost-effectiveness. They are less prone to breakage, making them suitable for regular use in medical settings. Both types serve crucial roles in hematology and biochemistry testing.</p></p>

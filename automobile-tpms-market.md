<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automobile Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market is categorized into two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS employs sensors within each tire to measure tire pressure directly, providing real-time data to the driver. In contrast, Indirect TPMS utilizes the vehicle's anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensors to monitor wheel speed and infer tire pressure changes indirectly. Both systems enhance safety by alerting drivers to tire pressure issues, but they differ in technology and precision.</p></p>

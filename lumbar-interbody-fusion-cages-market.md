<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lumbar Interbody Fusion Cages Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion Cage</li><li>Terior Lumbar Interbody Fusion Cage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lumbar interbody fusion cages market is primarily segmented into two types: posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) cages and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) cages. PLIF cages are designed to be inserted from the back, allowing for better access to the spine while maintaining stability. In contrast, TLIF cages are inserted at an angle from the side, which can minimize muscle disruption and enhance recovery. Both types aim to stabilize the vertebrae, promote fusion, and alleviate pain in patients with spinal disorders.</p></p>
